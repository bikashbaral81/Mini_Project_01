Project Title: Expense Tracker
    Objective:
    Create a command-line-based application that allows users to record daily expenses, view all expenses, and calculate the total spent. The app should use file handling to store data, and error handling for invalid inputs.

    Functional Requirements:
        Add Expense
            User enters a description and an amount.
            Save the data to a file expenses.txt in the format: description,amount.
            Validate that the amount is a positive number.
        View Expenses
            Read the expenses.txt file and display all saved records.
            View Total Spent
            Read all entries and calculate the sum of all expense amounts.
        Exit
            Gracefully exit the application.
