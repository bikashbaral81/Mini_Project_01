Project Title: Student Report Card Generator
    Problem Statement:
    Teachers want a simple CLI tool to enter student details and marks, store them, and generate a neat report card. The system must handle errors like missing files, invalid input, and duplicate entries.


    Features to Implement:
        Input student name, subjects, and marks.
        Validate marks (0–100).
        Prevent duplicate student entries.
        Save data in a file (report_data.json).
        Use a separate module report.py for logic.
        Handle:
            Missing data file
            Wrong marks (e.g. >100, <0)
            Duplicate student entries

    Sample run:

    Enter student name: Rahul
    Enter number of subjects: 3
    Enter subject name: Math
    Enter marks for Math (0-100): 88
    Enter subject name: Science
    Enter marks for Science (0-100): 76
    Enter subject name: English
    Enter marks for English (0-100): 69

    --- Report Card ---
    Name: Rahul
    Math: 88
    Science: 76
    English: 69
    Average: 77.67
    Result: Pass
