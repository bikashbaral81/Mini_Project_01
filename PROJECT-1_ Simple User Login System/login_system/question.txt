Project 1: Simple User Login System
    Problem Statement:
    Design a CLI-based login system where users can register and log in. Store user data in a file. Use modules for organizing logic and handle errors (like duplicate users or wrong credentials).

    Use a module auth.py for handling register and login.
    Store users in users.txt (format: username,password).

    Handle:
    File not found
    Duplicate usernames
    Wrong password

    Features:
    Register: Enter username and password. Save to file.
    Login: Validate credentials from file.
    Show welcome message on successful login.
